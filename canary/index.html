Hash: SHA256

Status: All good
Period: June 1 to December 31, 2018

As of 2018, Hokioi Security has not received any secret court orders, and have not been subject to any gag order by any FVEY secret courts, or any other similar court of any government.

Hokioi Security has never placed any backdoor subroutines or malicious code in any of our applications.

We also have not received any requests to do so, and neither would we do so under any duress.

Hokioi Security has never disclosed any user communications to any third party.

Regarding server seizures, in June, 2004 and October 2007, the NZ Police seized several of Hokioi Securityâ€™s servers.

These servers were returned and promptly destroyed as is the strict security policy of Hokioi Security.

All Hokioi Security server hardrives are encrypted.

Finally, even if Hokioi Security did receive any such secret court orders, we have never, and will never-ever fracking comply!!!
